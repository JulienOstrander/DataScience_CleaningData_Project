# DataScience_CleaningData_Project
This is the project for the peer-graded assignment in the DataScience course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

It contains the following files:

- run_analysis.R    : the script performing the analysis
- CodeBook.md       : variables, data, and any transformations performed
- CleanData.csv     : the tidy data set (step 4 in the assignment)
- SummaryData.csv   : the summarized data set (step 5 in the assignment)
- README.md         : this readme file

Note: the script requires that the Samsung data be located in the unpacked folder
structure provided ("UCI HAR Dataset") in your working directory.
